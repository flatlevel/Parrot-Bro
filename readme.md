# Parrot Bro v0.1

## How to run
	
Node-webkit is required for this project. Use 

	$ npm install -g nw

to get it. Then 	

	<parrotBro_dir>$ nw

to run it.

Parrot Bro expects to be connected to the drone for proper use, which typically involves a closed UDP network. The cloud module requires a wifi connection to the internet, and parrotbro is capable of switching between the two automatically.
